# Python
The repo includes all projects I have completed with Python.<br>
<br>
Each project is categorized under its own sub_folder, with ideally three resources.<br>
a. **README.md** (*an introduction of the project*) <br>
b. **Datasets.** (*used for analysis*) <br>
c. **Notebook** (*contains the script written for the task*)<br>
<br>
**(Projects ordered from latest to oldest.)**
<br>
